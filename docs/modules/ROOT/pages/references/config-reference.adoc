= Configuration Reference

The Operator can be configured in two ways:

. Per namespace backups. Optimal for shared clusters.
. Global settings with namespaced schedules. Optimal for private clusters.

== Environment Variables

`BACKUP_ANNOTATION`:: the annotation to be used for filtering, by default: `k8up.syn.tools/backup`
`BACKUP_BACKUPCOMMANDANNOTATION`:: set the annotation name that identify the backup commands on Pods, by default: `k8up.syn.tools/backupcommand`
`BACKUP_CHECKSCHEDULE`:: the default check schedule, by default: `0 0 * * 0`
`BACKUP_DATAPATH`:: to which path the PVCs should get mounted in the backup container, by default: `/data`
`BACKUP_ENABLE_LEADER_ELECTION`:: enable leader election within the operator Pod, default: `true`
`BACKUP_FILEEXTENSIONANNOTATION`:: set the annotation name where the file extension is stored for backup commands, default `k8up.syn.tools/file-extension`
`BACKUP_GLOBALACCESSKEYID`:: set the S3 access key id to be used globally
`BACKUP_GLOBAL_CONCURRENT_ARCHIVE_JOBS_LIMIT`:: set the limit of concurrent archive jobs
`BACKUP_GLOBAL_CONCURRENT_BACKUP_JOBS_LIMIT`:: set the limit of concurrent backup jobs
`BACKUP_GLOBAL_CONCURRENT_CHECK_JOBS_LIMIT`:: set the limit of concurrent check jobs
`BACKUP_GLOBAL_CONCURRENT_PRUNE_JOBS_LIMIT`:: set the limit of concurrent prune jobs
`BACKUP_GLOBAL_CONCURRENT_RESTORE_JOBS_LIMIT`:: set the limit of concurrent restore jobs
`BACKUP_GLOBAL_CPU_LIMIT`:: set the CPU limit for scheduled jobs
`BACKUP_GLOBAL_CPU_REQUEST`:: set the CPU request for scheduled jobs
`BACKUP_GLOBALKEEPJOBS`:: set the number of old backup jobs to keep globally
`BACKUP_GLOBAL_MEMORY_LIMIT`:: set the memory limit for scheduled jobs
`BACKUP_GLOBAL_MEMORY_REQUEST`:: set the memory request for scheduled jobs
`BACKUP_GLOBALREPOPASSWORD`:: set the restic repository password to be used globally
`BACKUP_GLOBALRESTORES3ACCESKEYID`:: set the global restore S3 accessKeyID for restores
`BACKUP_GLOBALRESTORES3BUCKET`:: set the global restore S3 bucket for restores
`BACKUP_GLOBALRESTORES3ENDPOINT`:: set the global restore S3 endpoint for the restores (needs the scheme [http/https]
`BACKUP_GLOBALRESTORES3SECRETACCESSKEY`:: set the global restore S3 SecretAccessKey for restores
`BACKUP_GLOBALS3BUCKET`:: set the S3 bucket to be used globally
`BACKUP_GLOBALS3ENDPOINT`:: set the S3 endpoint to be used globally
`BACKUP_GLOBALSECRETACCESSKEY`:: set the S3 secret access key to be used globally
`BACKUP_GLOBALSTATSURL`:: set the URL of wrestic to post additional metrics globally, default `""`
`BACKUP_IMAGE`:: URL of the restic image, default: `quay.io/vshn/wrestic:latest`
`BACKUP_JOBNAME`:: names for the backup job objects in OpenShift, default: `backupjob`
`BACKUP_LOG_LEVEL`:: Set to "debug" to enable verbose logging, default: `info`
`BACKUP_METRICS_BINDADDRESS`:: set the bind address for the prometheus endpoint, default: `:8080`
`BACKUP_PODEXECACCOUNTNAME`:: set the service account name that should be used for the pod command execution, default: `pod-executor`
`BACKUP_PODEXECROLENAME`:: set the role name that should be used for pod command execution, default `pod-executor`
`BACKUP_PODFILTER`:: the filter used to find the backup pods, default: `backupPod=true`
`BACKUP_PODNAME`:: names for the backup pod objects in OpenShift, default: `backupjob-pod`
`BACKUP_PROMURL`:: set the operator wide default prometheus push gateway, default `\http://127.0.0.1/`
`BACKUP_RESTARTPOLICY`:: set the RestartPolicy for the backup jobs. According to the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/[docs] this should be `OnFailure` for jobs that terminate, default: `OnFailure`

You only need to adjust `BACKUP_IMAGE`, everything else can be left default.

== Global Settings

Each variable starting with `BACKUP_GLOBAL*` can be used to declare a global default for all namespaces.
For example, if you configure the S3 bucket and credentials here, you wonâ€™t have to specify them in the Schedule or Backup resource definitions.

NOTE: It is always possible to overwrite the global settings. Simply declare the specific setting in the relevant resource definition and it will be applied instead of the global default.
