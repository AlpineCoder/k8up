= How to Create a Backup

The custom `Schedule` object defines the frequency, destination and secrets required to backup items in your namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$backup.yaml[]
----

Save the YAML above in a file named `backup.yml` and use the `kubectl apply -f backup.yml` command to deploy this configuration to your cluster.

The file above will instruct the operator to do backups every 5 minutes and a monthly prune, and check jobs for repository maintenance. It will also archive the latest snapshots to the `archive` bucket once each week.

After 5 minutes of running this demo, you should be able to run the command `minikube service minio-service` and see the backups in a `backups` bucket inside the web administration. Remember that the default access and secret keys are `minio` and `minio123` respectively.

Feel free to adjust the frequencies to your liking. To help you with the crontab syntax, we recommend to check https://crontab.guru[crontab.guru].

TIP: You can always check the state and configuration of your backup by using `kubectl describe schedule` * By default all PVCs are stored in backup. By adding the annotation `k8up.syn.tools/backup=false` to a PVC object it will get excluded from backup.

== Checking the Status of Backup Jobs

Every time a job starts, it creates a separate pod in your namespace. You can see them using `kubectl pods`. You can then use the usual `kubectl logs <POD NAME>` command to troubleshoot a failed backup job.

Additionally the operator exposes a `:8080/metrics` endpoint for prometheus scraping. This will give you additional metrics that can be used to find failed jobs. See the [Prometheus examples](https://github.com/vshn/k8up/blob/v0.1.10/manifest/examples/prometheus) in our Github repository.

== Application-Aware Backups

It's possible to define annotations on pods with backup commands. These backup commands should create an application-aware backup and stream it to stdout.

Define an annotation on pod:

[source,yaml]
----
<SNIP>
template:
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: mariadb
    annotations:
      k8up.syn.tools/backupcommand: mysqldump -uroot -psecure --all-databases
<SNIP>
----

With this annotation the operator will trigger that command inside the the container and capture the stdout to a backup.

Tested with:

* MariaDB
* MongoDB
* tar to stdout

But it should work with any command that has the ability to output the backup to stdout.
