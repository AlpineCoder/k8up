= K8up

K8up is a backup operator that will handle PVC and app backups on a k8s/OpenShift cluster.

All you need to do is create a backup `Schedule` object in the namespace you’d like to backup.
It’s that easy. K8up takes care of the rest. It also provides a Prometheus endpoint for monitoring.

K8up is currently under heavy development and far from feature complete. But it should already be stable enough for production use.

== How it works

A cluster wide Kubernetes Operator is responsible for processing the ``Backup`` objects and handle
the backup schedules. When it's time to do a backup, the operator scans the namespace for matching
PVCs and creates a backup job in the corresponding namespace, while mounting the matching PVCs under
``/data/<pvcname>``. Restic then backups the data from this location to the configured endpoint.

== Current limitations

. Only supports data from PVCs with access mode ``ReadWriteMany`` at the moment
. Backups aren't actively monitored / alerted yet

== Plans

. Active and automated monitoring by APPUiO staff
. Backup of cluster objects (deployments, configmaps, ...)
. Additional back-ends to S3 by using the rclone back-end of Restic
