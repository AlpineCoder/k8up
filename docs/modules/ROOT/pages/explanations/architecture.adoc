= K8up Architecture

K8up consists of two parts:

* Kubernetes Operator: https://github.com/vshn/k8up[K8up]
* Restic wrapper: https://github.com/vshn/k8up/[wrestic]

== High Level Description

A cluster wide Kubernetes Operator is responsible for processing the `Backup` objects and handle
the backup schedules. When it's time to do a backup, the operator scans the namespace for matching
PVCs and creates a backup job in the corresponding namespace, while mounting the matching PVCs under
`/data/<pvcname>`. Restic then backups the data from this location to the configured endpoint.

== Internal Architecture

The following diagram shows a high-level architecture of K8up internals.
This is mainly aimed at developers helping to understand the code.
But it could be interesting for anyone trying to understand an issue they may face with K8up.
