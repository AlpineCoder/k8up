= What has changed in K8up v1.0?

https://github.com/vshn/k8up/releases/tag/v1.0.0[K8up v1.0] is a big milestone for K8up.
Although K8up `1.x` itself is backwards compatible with `0.x` resources, the installation method has changed greatly.

K8up sprang to life before Operators "exploded" in the Kubernetes ecosystem.
There weren't many frameworks available then.
It was initially built with https://github.com/spotahome/kooper[Kooper], but for v1.0 it was rewritten and migrated the Operator to https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[Operator SDK] and https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder[Kubebuilder].

The resources should stay the same and are backwards compatible.
But the CRDs feature new properties and thus should be upgraded.
