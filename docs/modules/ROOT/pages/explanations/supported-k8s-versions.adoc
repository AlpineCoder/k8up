= Supported Kubernetes Versions

K8up officially has two support streams:

. Recent stable Kubernetes version
. OpenShift `3.11`

K8up supports legacy Kubernetes clusters such as OpenShift `3.11` (Kubernetes 1.11) as long VSHN (the company behind K8up) operates OpenShift `3.11` with K8up installed.
However, some new features are not supported on Kubernetes < `1.16`, e.g. High Availability with Leader election.

See the {page-origin-url}[Repository,window=_blank] which upstream Kubernetes version is supported.
