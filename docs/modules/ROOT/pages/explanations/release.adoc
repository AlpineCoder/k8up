= Releasing k8up

The release process is automated all the way through.
It starts when a maintainer pushes a new git tag.
This will trigger a GitHub Action which will, in turn, create:

- A GitHub release with a changelog based on the merged pull requests.
- A build of the Docker image, which is pushed to https://hub.docker.com/r/vshn/k8up[Docker Hub] and https://quay.io/vshn/k8up[Quay.io].

This process mostly relies on https://goreleaser.com/[GoReleaser].

== Git Tag

Note that we use the following format `v0.0.0` for git tags, see `git tags`.
We follow https://semver.org/[SemVer].
