= How to Check Status of Jobs

== Status of Backup Jobs

Every time a job starts, it creates a separate Pod in your namespace. You can see them using `kubectl get pods`.
You can then use the usual `kubectl logs <POD NAME>` command to troubleshoot a failed backup job.

== Metrics

The operator exposes a `:8080/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping.
This will give you additional metrics that can be used to find failed jobs.
See the https://github.com/vshn/k8up/blob/v0.1.10/manifest/examples/prometheus[Prometheus examples in our GitHub repository].
