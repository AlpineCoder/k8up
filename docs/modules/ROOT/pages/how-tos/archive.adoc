= Archive your Backups

For long-term storage of your backups you may want to use cheaper storage,
even if this is slower to restore, because you don't need to restore that
data frequently.

The custom `Archive` object defines the restore method and back-end required to archive backups of your namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$archive.yaml[]
----

Save the YAML above in a file named `archive.yml` and use the `kubectl apply -f archive.yml` command to deploy this configuration to your cluster.
